::: what are signals ? when to use signal programming ? 
  * event based programming implementation 
  * events pre_fetch, pre_save,pre_delete /post , user_logged_in/out 
::: optimise the code ??
  memory :caching, lazy_loading a module 
  computation time:use library func , filters , immutable objects 
  debug: debugtools , logger , session logs 
  sql_db: db index, partitions , limit , denormalise tbls , join query optimisation  
        : selectrelated() , prefetch_related() , only(), defer() , bulk_create()
  loadbalancer:aws, cloudfront
